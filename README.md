# jub-machine-learning

Here you can find the Machine Learning projects I and my lab partner have been working on as during my 4th semester.

They are coded in Python, and they cover the some fundamental elements of Machine Learning.


// Note: There might be a delay in availablity of the sub-projects due to a current occupation with examinations.
  // if so, worry not; the files will be available soon.
